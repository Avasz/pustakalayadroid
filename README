This may or may not be useful to other people,
but people working on E-Pustakalaya and Ordoid will surely find this useful.

One can find the details of this script in redmine of OLE Nepal.
This script basically tries to automate most of the manual stuffs needed while installing E-Pustakalaya in Odroid.
Main advantage I can say is, it minimizes the Human Errors and decreases the installation time.

If you need any more info on it, feel free to ping me.

Thanks!!
